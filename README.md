Project Description: LEGO Set Explorer

The LEGO Set Explorer is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to help users discover, analyze, and explore LEGO sets. This project combines data visualization with user interactivity to provide an engaging experience for LEGO enthusiasts, collectors, and buyers. By leveraging a LEGO dataset, the tool enables users to filter sets by price, age range, theme, and more, offering meaningful insights into the diverse world of LEGO.

Goals: The primary goals of the LEGO Set Explorer project are:

Data Exploration: Provide users with an intuitive way to explore LEGO sets using filters and dynamic visuals.
Insights Generation: Present key metrics and trends, such as price ranges, average pieces, and popular themes.
User Engagement: Design an interactive, visually appealing dashboard that caters to both casual users and dedicated collectors.
Business Needs: LEGO enthusiasts often seek tools that simplify the process of finding and comparing LEGO sets based on specific criteria such as age suitability, price, and theme. This project addresses the following business needs:

Enhancing customer decision-making with structured and easy-to-navigate data.
Boosting engagement through interactive visuals, slicers, and detailed views.
Delivering actionable insights for understanding customer preferences, potentially aiding marketing and sales strategies.
How the Project Discovers and Presents Meaningful Insights:

Data Preparation:
Connected to the LEGO dataset, removed irrelevant fields, and ensured data quality by filtering out incomplete records.
Created custom columns for categorizing sets by Age Range (e.g., “Over 18,” “5 to 9”) and Price Range (e.g., “$$” for sets above $500).
Developed measures to calculate key performance indicators, including Total Sets, Total Groups, Avg. Price, Avg. Pieces, and Avg. Age.
Interactive Features:
Dynamic Filters: Added slicers for theme group, theme, and age range, allowing users to refine their search.
Detailed Set Views: Enabled users to view detailed information about selected sets, including images, names, prices, pieces, and years.
Tooltips: Incorporated image tooltips on hover to display LEGO set visuals directly in the table, enhancing exploration.
Advanced Functionalities:
Implemented a numeric price range slicer (0 to $850) for dynamic filtering based on user-defined price limits.
Configured reset filters functionality using bookmarks and buttons to improve navigation and usability.
Designed a decomposition tree visual to analyze Total Sets by category, theme group, theme, and name, offering deeper insights into set distribution.
Visual and Report Design:
Crafted a clean, visually engaging layout with card visuals for quick metrics (e.g., Total Sets, Avg. Price, Avg. Pieces).
Designed a multi-page report, with the first page focused on exploration and the second page featuring advanced analytics through the decomposition tree.
Customized interaction settings to prevent table selections from filtering overall metrics, ensuring accurate data presentation.
Conclusion: The LEGO Set Explorer is a powerful tool for discovering and analyzing LEGO sets, offering a seamless user experience with meaningful insights. Whether users are casual buyers or dedicated collectors, the dashboard provides a structured way to explore the vast LEGO collection, helping them make informed decisions. This project exemplifies how data visualization and interactivity can transform raw data into a valuable resource for both users and businesses.
